# Java-OOP-Assignments
 
This repository includes some of the programming assignments I completed during my Junior year. These projects encompass various tasks and challenges designed to build and refine my Object Oriented Programming skills using Java.

There are 5 different assignments in this repository with their reports that explain how the algorithms work. 

# Assignment 1: Average of Small Numbers
This program was created to calculate the average of the numbers that are less than or equal to 
10 in the series of numbers created by the user

#Assignment 2: Circles
This program was created to draw circles using the numbers entered by the user as radii.

#Assignment 4: Metro Routes
This program was developed to simulate the metro routes for the particular metro lines in Istanbul.


#Assignment 5: Drops
This program was created to animate dropping balls using the “Ball” and “Platform” classes.

#Assignment 6:  Cat Simulation
This program was created to animate a randomly moving cat in a world of blocks.
