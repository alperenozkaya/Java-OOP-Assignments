# Java-OOP-Assignments
 
This repository includes some of the programming assignments I completed during my Junior year. These projects encompass various tasks and challenges designed to build and refine my Object Oriented Programming skills using Java.


There are 5 different assignments in this repository with their reports that explain how the algorithms work. 

<h3> Assignment 1: Average of Small Numbers </h3> 
This program was created to calculate the average of the numbers that are less than or equal to 
10 in the series of numbers created by the user.

<h2> Assignment 2: Circles </h2> 
This program was created to draw circles using the numbers entered by the user as radii.

<h2> Assignment 4: Metro Routes </h2> 
This program was developed to simulate the metro routes for the particular metro lines in Istanbul.

<h2> Assignment 5: Drops </h2> 
This program was created to animate dropping balls using the “Ball” and “Platform” classes.

<h2> Assignment 6: Cat Simulation </h2> 
This program was created to animate a randomly moving cat in a world of blocks.
